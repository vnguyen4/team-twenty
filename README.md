## Installation

Setting up the USDA InfoPilot solution involves configuring a development environment, installing necessary prerequisites, and integrating various tools and services. This comprehensive setup ensures that the solution operates seamlessly, providing users with enhanced search capabilities, AI-powered assistance, and efficient knowledge management.

### Prerequisites

To begin with, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your system:

1. **Node.js and npm**: Node.js serves as the JavaScript runtime for building the front-end components, while npm (Node Package Manager) manages the project's dependencies.
2. **Python**: Python is utilized for backend processing and running AI models.
3. **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) facilitates the management of AWS services from the command line, essential for deploying backend services.
4. **Salesforce CLI**: This tool is necessary for interacting with Salesforce, particularly for managing knowledge articles.
5. **Git**: Git is employed for version control, allowing you to clone repositories and manage code changes effectively.

### Setting Up the Environment

The setup process begins by cloning the repository containing the solution's source code. This repository includes both the front-end and back-end components necessary for the solution.

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the front-end directory to install the required Node.js dependencies. This step ensures that all necessary packages are available for developing and running the front-end application.

Simultaneously, setting up a Python virtual environment in the backend directory helps isolate the project’s dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects. Within this environment, you can install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Integrating AI and Cloud Services

To harness the power of AI, the solution integrates the Cohere SDK and OpenAI API. The Cohere SDK can be easily installed via pip, facilitating seamless AI model integration. Additionally, configuring the AWS CLI with your credentials enables smooth deployment of backend services to AWS.

Authenticating the Salesforce CLI with your Salesforce org is crucial for managing knowledge articles effectively. This integration ensures that all knowledge management activities are synchronized with the Salesforce platform.

### Configuring Environment Variables

Environment variables play a vital role in managing configuration settings securely. By creating a `.env` file, you can store sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials securely. This file ensures that the necessary credentials are available to the application without hardcoding them into the source code.

### Database Initialization and Backend Deployment

If the solution requires a database, initializing it ensures that the necessary tables and schemas are set up. This step is crucial for storing user data, knowledge articles, metadata, and chat logs.

Deploying backend services to AWS involves using AWS CloudFormation, which automates the setup of resources and infrastructure. This deployment ensures that the backend services are scalable and reliable, providing robust support for the solution’s functionalities.

### Frontend and Backend Operation

Once the environment is configured and services are deployed, starting the front-end development server allows you to view and interact with the application in your browser. Concurrently, running the backend services locally enables API requests and responses, ensuring the application operates smoothly.

### Final Steps

After the initial setup, it’s essential to test the installation to verify that both the front-end and backend are functioning correctly. This involves accessing the local application URL, making API requests, and ensuring that all integrated services operate as expected.

Troubleshooting any issues involves checking logs for error messages and referring to documentation for each component (Node.js, Python, AWS CLI, Salesforce CLI). This ensures that any configuration or operational issues are promptly resolved, maintaining the integrity and performance of the solution.
